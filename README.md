# nf4 for flixel

0xFireball's extension library for HaxeFlixel.

It aims to provide some common functionality not yet available in flixel.
However, I often submit pull requests to flixel to integrate some of the capabilities upstream.
Features that have been integrated into HaxeFlixel will remain in nf4 until the next stable flixel
release that includes the features.

## Features

- Basic, but flexible UI system completely independent of HaxeFlixel's UI. This is still experimental.
- Common math utilities \*
- Gamepad utilities \*
- Basic particle emitter that isn't a single sprite itself like FlxEmitter. Rather, it functions as a statewide particle manager. May be useful for ambient effects.
- NFSprite: some small extensions to FlxSprite

`*` - Changes submitted and merged to upstream
